# Newspaper-style-webpage
A website designed in pattern of a newspaper, is just another eye-catchy things to experience. Customisable fonts (tried to give a newspaper appearance), Animated paper roller- start screen (javascript enabled loading).

These webpage is under construction, as I have not introduced the responsiveness into it. (Not responsive to all screen size)

## Setup the project: 
leave a star‚≠ê point in github profile and clone or fork the whole project and run into your favorite IDE ( my favorite is VS-CODE and CODE-STUDIO, for android mobile).
presently runned and edited these project on my android phone using the above editor.
